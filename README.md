# Development

1. Get [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) `curl -s
   http://getcomposer.org/installer | php` and then run `php composer.phar
   install --dev`. This is needed to set up testing tools (installs into
   `bin/`).
2. Use [Phing](http://www.phing.info/) to run `phing all` in project root. This
   will run `phpspec`, `phpcs`, `pdepend`, `phpmd`, `phpcpd`, `phpdcd`
   and `phpdoc2`. `phing` by itself is a shorthand to run just PHPSpec. For more
   information, see `phing -projecthelp`
3. Start developing. Specs are in `spec/`, documentation is in `docs/`. Any
   build logs generated by `phing all-log` useful for CI can be found in
   `build/`.
